# Veteran Facility Agent Prototype

A fully functional AI-powered agent that helps veterans find nearby VA facilities and get intelligent transportation recommendations. Built from the ground up using Node.js, local LLM processing, and real-time API integrations, this system provides veterans with comprehensive facility information, services available, and weather-aware travel guidanceâ€”all while maintaining complete data privacy through local processing.

**What makes this special:** Unlike cloud-based solutions, this agent runs entirely on your local machine (optimized for MacBook Air M2 and similar hardware), ensuring veteran data never leaves your computer while still providing sophisticated AI-powered recommendations. The system integrates real VA facility data, Google Maps geocoding, weather analysis, and local LLM reasoning to deliver personalized guidance for veteran facility visits.

A self-contained AI agent application designed to help veterans find nearby VA facilities and get weather-aware transportation recommendations. **Optimized to run efficiently on conventional laptops** with local processing and smart resource management.

## Overview

This application takes an address or coordinates as input and provides veterans with:
- The nearest VA facility based on their location
- Multiple transportation options to reach the facility
- Weather-aware recommendations that adjust based on current and forecasted conditions
- Backup transportation suggestions during inclement weather

The agent is built with privacy and independence in mind, using local LLM processing and containerized deployment to ensure veteran data remains secure and the system operates without external dependencies. **The solution is specifically optimized for resource-constrained environments**, including MacBook Air M2 systems with 16GB RAM, making advanced AI capabilities accessible without requiring specialized hardware or cloud dependencies.

## Core Functionality

### Location Processing

- Filters by facility type (medical centers, clinics, etc.)
- Provides facility details including services, hours, and contact information

### Transportation Intelligence
- Integrates with public transit APIs for route planning
- Provides multiple transportation options with timing and cost estimates
- Generates deep links to rideshare applications when appropriate
- Includes veteran-specific transportation services (VA shuttles, DAV services)

### Weather-Aware Recommendations
